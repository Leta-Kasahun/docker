📁 PART 1: STANDARD PROJECT FOLDERS & FILES

---
src/

Contains all application source code that Docker runs in production.

src/index.js

Main entry point where the server starts.

src/app.js

App configuration (middleware, routes, error handling).

src/routes/

Defines API endpoints and request paths.

src/controllers/

Handles HTTP requests and responses logic.

src/services/

Contains business logic and external integrations.

src/models/

Defines database schemas or ORM models.

src/config/

Manages environment-based configurations (DB, ports, secrets).

tests/

Holds automated tests used by CI/CD pipelines.

public/

Stores static assets like images, CSS, or frontend builds.

scripts/

Automation scripts for migrations, seeding, or maintenance.

package.json

Defines project metadata, dependencies, and run scripts.

yarn.lock

Locks exact dependency versions to ensure consistent builds.

.npmrc / .yarnrc

Configures package manager behavior and private registries.

.env

Stores environment variables and secrets (never committed).

.env.example

Documents required environment variables for developers.

.gitignore

Prevents unwanted files from being tracked by Git.

.dockerignore

Prevents unnecessary or sensitive files from entering Docker images.

README.md

Documents how to build, run, and use the project.

.eslint.json

Defines coding rules to maintain code quality.

.prettierrc

Controls automatic code formatting standards.

docker-compose.yml

Runs multiple services together (app, database, cache).

docker-compose.override.yml

Overrides compose settings for local development.

----

🐳 PART 2: DOCKERFILE INSTRUCTIONS 

---
FROM

Defines the base operating system and runtime environment.

WORKDIR

Sets a consistent working directory inside the container.

COPY

Copies project files into the Docker image.

ADD

Copies files and optionally extracts archives (rarely used).

RUN

Executes commands during image build (install, compile).

ENV

Sets environment variables inside the container.

ARG

Defines build-time variables used only during image creation.

EXPOSE

Documents the port the application listens on.

USER

Runs the app as a non-root user for security.

VOLUME

Creates persistent storage outside the container lifecycle.

HEALTHCHECK

Monitors container health for orchestration systems.

CMD

Specifies the default command to run when the container starts.

ENTRYPOINT

Defines a fixed startup command that cannot be overridden easily.

Here are the key differences between yarn.lock, package-lock.json, and spec in Docker concepts:
yarn.lock: This file is generated by Yarn when you run Yarn commands. It contains the exact versions of all installed dependencies, ensuring that all developers using Yarn have the same versions of packages. 
2
package-lock.json: This file is automatically generated by npm when you install packages. It records the exact versions of all installed packages, including their dependencies and sub-dependencies, ensuring consistent installations across different environments. 
2
Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the environment, dependencies, and build steps required to create a Docker image.

These files serve different purposes in managing dependencies and building images in their respective contexts

🔁 HOW EVERYTHING WORKS TOGETHER (MENTAL MODEL)

Code lives in src/, dependencies are defined in package.json, locked by yarn.lock, filtered by .dockerignore, built by Dockerfile, configured via .env, and run as a container using Docker or Docker Compose.
